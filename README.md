# Airport
Week 1 challenge

This was the first Friday challenge at Makers, after a gruelling week of "Boris Bikes" in Ruby using OOP techniques. The Airport challenge consolidated what we had learnt during the week and helped us to really identify whether we had grasped the concepts properly! I found that it was a great way to crystalize my knowledge. My approach was to focus on the more straightforward elements first (e.g. the plane objects) before contemplating how to deal with the randomised weather scenarios. This served me well, and a TDD approach also helped to ensure that my methods were complete. The trickiest part was stubbing out the weather test - I needed to follow up with the coaches after the weekend on this.
